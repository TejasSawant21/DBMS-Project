📖 Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of Database Management Systems (DBMS) with data visualization, executed in Google Colab. It is suitable for students and professionals exploring database management, Python programming, and data science.

✨ Key Highlights

Developed using DBMS principles and Google Colab for an interactive environment.

Utilizes SQL databases for data storage and Python for data analysis and visualization.

Suitable for data science, database management, and visualization enthusiasts.

Easily adaptable for custom datasets and additional features.

🛠️ Features

🔹 Database Management

Store and manage structured data using SQL databases.

Perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on datasets.

Execute SQL queries to extract meaningful insights.

🔹 Data Analysis

Import, clean, and manipulate datasets using Pandas and NumPy.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to derive insights from structured data.

🔹 Data Visualization

Generate high-quality visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Includes bar graphs, scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps for trend analysis.

🔹 Cloud-Based Notebook

Fully executed in Google Colab, eliminating local setup and configuration hassles.

Supports integration with Google Drive for easy file management.

🚀 How to Get Started

Step 1: Open the Notebook

Click here to open the notebook directly in Google Colab.

Step 2: Load the Notebook

Sign in to your Google account if not already logged in.
